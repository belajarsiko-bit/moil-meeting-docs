# Modes

Learn which mode fits each meeting or monitoring scenario. Each mode is optimized for a specific type of room activity.

## Operational Modes

### Original Mode
**Purpose:** Full-scope monitoring and situational awareness.

Displays the raw feed from the fisheye camera without de-warping. This mode is essential for seeing the complete, uncropped capture area, ensuring no detail is missed at the periphery.

### Discussion Mode
**Purpose:** Interactive team collaboration.

Facilitates dynamic interaction by combining a panoramic overview with zoomed-in views of specific participants. The layout is customizable, allowing users to adjust the number and position of viewports to match the meeting size.

### Global Mode
**Purpose:** International meetings and large-scale room coverage.

Designed for comprehensive visibility, this mode creates a split-screen layout showing a dual panoramic strip. It provides a flat, "unwrapped" view of the entire room, making remote participants feel as if they are seated at the center of the conference table.

### Patrol Mode
**Purpose:** Surveillance and automated presenting.

Automatically pans the view across the panoramic scene from right to left (or vice versa). This "scanning" behavior is ideal for monitoring large spaces or for presentations where the camera needs to dynamically shift focus across a stage.

### Presentation Mode
**Purpose:** Content focus and detail highlighting.

Allows the presenter to lock onto a specific "Anypoint" area. The software de-warps and zooms into this region, providing a clear, distortion-free view of a whiteboard, speaker, or screen, minimizing visual distractions from the rest of the room.
