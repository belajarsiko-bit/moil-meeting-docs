## What is Fisheye Lens Technology?

Fisheye lens technology is a specialized optical system that provides ultra-wide-angle views, typically covering 180 degrees or more.

### How It Works

A fisheye lens captures a hemispherical field of view by using a curved lens element that bends light from a wide area onto the camera sensor. This creates the characteristic "fisheye" distortion in the resulting image.

### Advantages of Fisheye Technology

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Wide Coverage | Single camera covers entire room |
| No Moving Parts | No need for mechanical pan/tilt |
| Complete Overview | See all participants simultaneously |
| Cost Effective | One fisheye camera replaces multiple standard cameras |

### Dewarping

The Moil Meeting application uses advanced dewarping algorithms to transform the distorted fisheye image into natural-looking perspectives:

- **Panoramic Views** — Create wide, undistorted panoramic images
- **Perspective Correction** — Extract natural views from specific areas
- **Multi-view Generation** — Create multiple corrected views simultaneously

### Applications in Video Conferencing

Fisheye technology enables:

1. **Complete Room Coverage** — Capture all participants with a single camera
2. **Flexible Views** — Extract different views from the same video source
3. **No Blind Spots** — Ensure no area is missed during meetings
4. **Dynamic Focus** — Switch focus between different areas without moving the camera
